## Setting Up 
I used NPM.  
Refer to https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-js-and-mocha  
It was mainly just `npm install --save mocha chai express request  `  

## Running tests 
Once you have some tests in the test directory you just say  
`npx mocha --reporter spec`
