## Philosophy
Nick Parlante (Stanford) says a developer should be:"practiced and quick with these little bits of code. Skill with the little code allows (you) to concentrate on the larger parts of the problem. Or put another other way, someone who struggles with the loops, logic, etc. does not have time for the big picture. "
