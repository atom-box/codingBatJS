# Coding Challenges
## What's going on here
I have written 95% of the code in this repository.<br><br>Check it out:<br>

## Diary
The idea, to quote Nick Parlante (Stanford), is to be "practiced and quick with these little bits of code. Skill with the little code allows students to concentrate on the larger parts of the problem. Or put another other way, someone who struggles with the loops, logic, etc. does not have time for the big picture. "<br><br>
My focus for awhile shifted towards becoming facile with the functional parts of JS, since they save time but are also more maintainable, especially <i>reduce, map, and some</i>.<br> 
Lately I am at a point where I am having fun pulling it all together.  I can intuitively implement React and CSS around these Fizz Buzz types of questions.  

## Sources for Challenges
* Many are from Stanford U's [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com) which now has recursive and _functional_ problems.
* Also, this free pdf:  [The Code Challenge Book: How to Ace the Coding Bootcamp Technical Interview](   https://coderbyte.com/ebook).  This is not the same as the premium-but-worth-it Cracking the Coding Interview.  
* Some of the DOM challenges are from [Burdwan](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-dom-exercises.php), WestBengal, India
* [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) which now has added some exercises with concurrency.
## Possible future ideas
* Go back and write unit tests for these with edge cases in Selenium, Cocoa or similar
* Write javascript implementations of the old (Pascal) Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick; the book (c)1980.
* [Sol LeWitt](https://solvingsol.com/solutions/) drawing implementations.  In Canvas?
* [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) is one of those funky "write it in many languages" sites.
