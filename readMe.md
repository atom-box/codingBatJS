# Coding Challenges

## The programs
Every file above is a standalone Javascript file that can be run in node.js or in the browser as html

## What's going on here
The idea, to quote Nick Parlante (Stanford), is to be "practiced and quick with these little bits of code. Skill with the little code allows students to concentrate on the larger parts of the problem. Or put another other way, someone who struggles with the loops, logic, etc. does not have time for the big picture. "<br>
My focus for awhile shifted towards becoming facile with the functional parts of JS, since they save time but are also more maintainable, especially <i>reduce, map, and some</i>.  Lately I am trying to become fast with DOM events/selectors.

## Source
* At first I just took exercises straight from Stanford U's [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com) but now when I go to that site I try to remix their challenge with whatever book I'm studying, like the Crockett, Flanagan, Duckett, or Nicholas Zakas Javascript books for example.
* Good too, this free pdf:  [The Code Challenge Book: How to Ace the Coding Bootcamp Technical Interview](   https://coderbyte.com/ebook)
* Some of the DOM challenges are from [Burdwan](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-dom-exercises.php), WestBengal, India
## Possible future ideas
* Go back and write unit tests for these with edge cases in Selenium, Cocoa or similar
* Write javascript implementations of the old (Pascal) Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick; the book (c)1980.
