# Coding Bat Exercises

## The programs
Every file above is a standalone js file that can be run in node.js<br/>
The bottom of each file has explanatory comments about the assigned exercise.<br/>
I solve these in the morning before I go to work.  Sometimes I solve them at lunch.

## Dev Diary
1/3/2019:  Thanks Nick Parlante for recursion advice.  Thanks Dave Jenkins for real world recursion discussion.

## Future Ideas
* Go back and re do a couple of these with crazier edge cases.  Put them into their own Testing repository with Cocoa or similar tester
* Re do in Elm language
* Shop in some Knuth for re-do.  Benchmark each!
* Re do as excuse for a front end bootstrap, unsplash, CSS-Flexbox & Grid

## Coding Bat
The original <em>Coding Bat</em> is an efficient lightweight drill site for Stanford University freshmen.<br/>
http://codingbat.com/
<br/>
There's no registration or anything required at all.<br/>
A robot at Coding Bat gives you feedback, showing your graph of where you got stuck, at how many seconds.  It 
shows you random graphs of stuck-time for anonymous peer users.  So cool and elegant!  

## Additional sources
Lately I've been enjoying a free drills-book by the Fullstack Bootcamp in New York.  They published fizz-buzz-type exercises in this free pdf:  "The Code Challenge Book: How to Ace the Coding Bootcamp Technical Interview"   https://coderbyte.com/ebook <br/>
Next on deck might be Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick, which has state-of-the-art practices, really professional-level stuff.  My copy is the 1st edition so it is state-of-the-art in 1980, but, a lot of this stuff, like Quicksort, isn't going away any time soon. The book is so old that the pedagogical examples are written in Pascal.
