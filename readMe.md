# Coding Bat Exercises

## The original
The original coding bat is a really efficient lightweight drill site for writing five line snippets of 
code.  A robot gives you feedback, showing your graph of where you got stuck, at how many seconds.  It 
shows you random graphs of stuck-time for anonymous peer users.  So cool and elegant!  It is from a 
Stanford professor.

## My activity
The Coding Bat site is only for Python and Java.  I'm trying some of the exercises as JS.
