/**
SWITCHING LIGHTBULBS PROBLEM
There are 100 light bulbs, labeled from 1 to 100, lined up all set to off initially. There are also 100 people each numbered 1 to 100 as well. Person 1 will go through all the light bulbs and flip the switch turning all of them on. Then person number 2 will go through all the light bulbs and flip the switch on each 2nd element turning them off, namely: light bulbs #2, #4, #6, #8, etc. Then person 3 will go and do the same for the 3rd ligh bulb, 6th, 9th, etc. Then questions are usually asked about the light bulbs, for example:
• How many light bulbs will be on after 100 people have gone through them?
• What is the status of the Nth light bulb (34th, 62nd, etc.)? Is it on or off?
• How many people need to go through the line of light bulbs until exactly K light bulbs are set
to on?

	bulbsList Array of booleans.  A list of the bulbs, whether lit or not.
