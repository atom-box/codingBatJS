                     1. Explain what citizenship in the nation means and what
                        it takes to be a good citizen of this country. Discuss the
                        rights, duties, and obligations of a responsible and active
                        American citizen.

                        a.  Visit a place that is listed as a National Historic
                            Landmark or that is on the National Register of Historic
                            Places. Tell your counselor what you learned about
                            the landmark or site and what you found interesting
                            about it.
                        b.  Tour your state capitol building or the U.S. Capitol.
                            Tell your counselor what you learned about the capitol,
                            its function, and its history.
                        c.  Tour a federal facility. Explain to your counselor what
                            you saw there and what you learned about its function
                            in the local community and how it serves this nation.
                        d.  Choose a national monument that interests you. Using
                            books, brochures, the Internet (with your parent’s
                            permission), and other resources, find out more about
                            the monument. Tell your counselor what you learned,
                            and explain why the monument is important to this
                            country’s citizens.

                     3. Watch the national evening news five days in a row OR
                        read the front page of a major daily newspaper five days
                        in a row. Discuss the national issues you learned about
                        with your counselor. Choose one of the issues and explain
                        how it affects you and your family.

   preamble to the Constitution. Discuss with your
   counselor how these functions affect your family and

   national historical importance. Find out about the author,
   and tell your counselor about the person who gave the
   speech. Explain the importance of the speech at the time
   it was given, and tell how it applies to American citizens
   today. Choose a sentence or two from the speech that has
   significant meaning to you, and tell your counselor why.

7. Name the three branches of our federal government and
   explain to your counselor their functions. Explain how
   citizens can be involved in each branch. Explain the impor-
   tance of our checks and balances system. Describe how
   each branch “checks” and “balances” the others.

   Congress from your congressional district. Write a
   letter about a national issue and send it to one of these
   elected officials, sharing your view with him or her.
   Show your letter to your counselor, along with any
   response you might receive.
