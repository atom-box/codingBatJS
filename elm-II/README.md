## Scratchpad
Remember the Elm syntax
## Easiest way on a fresh machine to get going
Install Elm. With that installed, get the Html package from the command line:

    elm-package install elm-lang/html

After that, grab a copy of the elm solution from GitHub. Now, in the same folder as the new file, run the following from the command line:

    elm reactor

This will basically launch a local server for testing.
