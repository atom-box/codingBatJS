## Easiest way on a fresh machine to get going
Install Elm. With that installed, get the Html package from the command line:

    elm-package install elm-lang/html

After that, grab a copy of the elm solution from GitHub. Now, in the same folder as the new file, run the following from the command line:

    elm reactor

This will basically launch a local server for testing.

## to do:
* Find your static page, or the rocket bluebook.  Build a static page just as a foundation 0.0 thing.
* Build Evan's button in JS!

* Read Evan's current at gitbook.  Build the button on paper, maybe.
and look up 
* Maybe look up projects other people builtin Elm-community-emails-orTwitterElmLang or Youtube.
